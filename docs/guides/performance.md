# Performance

Performance is the selling point against Python, so it is measured from Lot 1 with
[BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/), not estimated.

## Reproduce

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project bench/DataNet.Text.Benchmarks -- --filter '*Levenshtein*'
dotnet run -c Release --project bench/DataNet.Text.Benchmarks -- --filter '*VectorizerBenchmarks*' '*FuzzBenchmarks*'
```

## Principles applied

- **`ReadOnlySpan<char>` everywhere.** Inputs are never copied; `string` literals
  convert with no allocation.
- **`ArrayPool<int>` for the dynamic-programming matrices.** The DP row is rented
  then returned: **zero managed allocation per call**, so no GC pressure even
  under heavy load.
- **Rolling DP row on the shorter operand** → `O(min(n, m))` memory.
- **Common prefix/suffix trimming** → collapses the DP band on near-equal inputs
  (the common case in record matching).

## Levenshtein — indicative numbers

Short-job measurement (reduced iterations: means are noisy, but the allocation
column is reliable). Re-run with a full job before quoting.

| Method | Length | Mean | Allocated |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `Distance` (UTF-16) | 8 | ~35 ns | **0 B** |
| `Distance` (code point) | 8 | ~208 ns | **0 B** |
| `Distance` (UTF-16) | 64 | ~7.0 µs | **0 B** |
| `Distance` (UTF-16) | 512 | ~21 µs | **0 B** |

**Zero allocation** at every size is the structural result. On very short inputs
the code-point mode costs ~5× the UTF-16 mode (the decode pass dominates when the
computation itself is tiny); from 64+ characters the gap closes. Hence the choice:
**UTF-16 by default**, `CodePoint` on demand.

## Compared to Python (rapidfuzz) — Levenshtein

Cross-language bench with **identical methodology on both sides** (same committed
ASCII corpus, ns/pair throughput, auto-scaling, best-of-5). See
[`bench/README.md`](../../bench/README.md).

Indicative measurement (rapidfuzz 3.14.5 / Python 3.12; DataNet.Text / .NET 10 on
an Intel i7-4770S; dev machine — non-authoritative), **after** adding the blocked
(multi-word) Myers fast path:

| Length | Python (rapidfuzz) | C# (DataNet.Text) | Ratio | C# path |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| 8 | 183 ns/pair | **36 ns/pair** | **5.1× C# faster** | DP |
| 32 | **324 ns/pair** | 453 ns/pair | 1.4× Python | Myers (single word) |
| 128 | 2 693 ns/pair | **1 777 ns/pair** | **1.5× C# faster** | Myers (blocked) |
| 512 | 21 688 ns/pair | **20 555 ns/pair** | **1.06× C# faster** | Myers (blocked) |

- **Short strings (≤ ~40)** — the typical name/identifier matching case: C# is
  ahead, largely because rapidfuzz pays per-call interop overhead there.
- **Long strings** — previously 13–31× *behind* rapidfuzz, because patterns over
  64 characters fell back to the DP. Blocked Myers closed that: the 512 bucket
  went from 684 µs to 21 µs, a 33× improvement, and now edges ahead. It was never
  a language problem, only an algorithmic one.
- **The length-32 bucket is the remaining gap**, at 1.4× behind. It already takes
  the single-word path, so this is not the same cause; it wants its own
  measurement rather than a guess.
- **Scope.** The bit-parallel path requires a Latin-1 pattern. Outside that — CJK,
  emoji — `Distance` still uses the DP, so the figures above do not describe those
  inputs. Extending the equality table beyond Latin-1 is unresolved; see
  [`../decisions/0004-levenshtein-myers-backlog.md`](../decisions/0004-levenshtein-myers-backlog.md).

## Vectorizers and fuzzy matching

Short-job measurement, `[MemoryDiagnoser]` (dev machine — indicative).

**Vectorizers**, fit+transform over a synthetic corpus:

| Method | 200 docs | 1000 docs |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `CountVectorizer` | ~4.2 ms | ~9.0 ms |
| `TfidfVectorizer` | ~4.3 ms | ~9.1 ms |
| `CountVectorizer` (bigrams) | ~4.8 ms | ~14.7 ms |
| `HashingVectorizer` | ~3.6 ms | ~8.6 ms |

**Fuzzy ratios**, on a ~43-character sentence pair:

| Method | Mean | Allocated |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `Fuzz.Ratio` | ~2.5 µs | **0 B** |
| `Fuzz.TokenSortRatio` | ~5.3 µs | 1.3 KB |
| `Fuzz.TokenSetRatio` | ~15 µs | 5.6 KB |
| `Fuzz.WRatio` | ~25 µs | 7.0 KB |
| `Fuzz.PartialRatio` | ~460 µs | 0 B |

> `PartialRatio` is markedly slower: the current sliding-window scan is `O(n·m²)`
> (a full Indel per window). It is correct and zero-alloc, but a bit-parallel or
> block-based optimization is a clear backlog item for long inputs.
