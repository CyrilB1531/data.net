"""Assert the shipped NuGet dependency graph is exactly the intended one.

`dotnet pack` derives a package's ``<dependencies>`` from whatever the project
resolved at restore time, so the graph consumers see is a *build output*, not
something anyone wrote down. That makes it easy to change by accident: a
PackageReference added for a compile-time helper without ``PrivateAssets=all``
lands in it, and a dependency that quietly disappears is worse still — the
package installs and then fails at run time on a missing assembly.

The expected graph below is the written-down version. It is deliberately exact:
an unexpected dependency fails just as loudly as a missing one, and so does a
dependency whose declared version range has moved — an edge with the wrong floor
is a different edge, however right its id looks.

Usage:  python tools/check_nuspec_dependencies.py <artifacts-directory> [--require-all]

``--require-all`` additionally fails when a known package is absent, which is
what CI wants after packing all three. A release job packs exactly one package,
so it omits the flag.
